# NLW Heat | Domain Drive Design

![banner](banner.png)

> Another project carried out at the Rocketseat event, `Next Level Week - Heat`, in this edition we build an end-to-end application, with
> the purpose of authenticating the user via Github's authentication provider so that the user can send a message about the expectations of the event.
> The application was initially developed following good back-end development practices, such as `separating controller responsibilities into services`,
> as you can see in the `main` branch, but when redoing the project I used `Domain Drive Design` concepts to improve my knowledge of clean architecture.
